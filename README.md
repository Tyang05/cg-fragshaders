# cg-fragshaders project
In this project, I manipulated the fragment shaders of a short snippet video taken from the Transformers movie. These fragment shaders basically create the filter for the video. There are a total of six different fragment shaders, each affecting the video in different ways. 

The first of the six different fragment shaders is the normal fragment shader. This just converts the video back to its original colors. The black and white fragment shader does what its name suggests, it turns the video into black and white. It does this by looking at the colors in the original video and puts them on a scale from white to black. If the color is closer to the color white, it'll convert that part to be white. Then it'll do the opposite for black. The fish eye fragment shader adds the fish eye affect. It makes it look like you are watching the video through a fish eye where the middle portion of the video is zoomed in. The ripple fragment shader adds a ripple affect to the video. The toon fragment shader makes the video look more cartoonish by blending the colors a bit together. Then the custom fragment shader basically just adds a warm tone to the video, similar to adding a "summer" or "fall" filter to an instagram photo.
